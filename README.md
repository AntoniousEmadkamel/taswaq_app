## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Principles

- **Domain Layer:**
    - Contains business logic, entities, and use cases.
- **Data Layer:**
    - Responsible for data sources (remote/local), models, and repository implementations.
- **Presentation Layer:**
    - UI code structured into screens, widgets, blocs (state management), and events/states.


**Benefits:**
- High testability.
- Easy to extend features and swap implementations.
- Clear ownership and responsibility for each part.

---

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Flutter** (UI Framework)
- **Dart** (Programming Language)
- **flutter_bloc + bloc:** State management architecture.
- **injectable + get_it:** Dependency injection for scalable, decoupled code.
- **Dio:** Powerful HTTP client for API calls.
- **dartz:** Functional programming helpers (Either, Option, etc.).
- **shared_preferences:** Local persistent storage for tokens and user data.
- **flutter_screenutil:** Responsive design and adaptive sizing.
- **cached_network_image:** Efficient image loading/caching.
- **carousel_slider, flutter_image_slideshow:** Product image carousels.
- **meta:** Annotations and type checking.
- **cupertino, material:** Platform-adaptive widgets.
- **Custom error/failure classes:** Strongly-typed error handling across the app.
